# 🌍 Disaster Relief Coordination Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Disaster Relief Coordination Platform** built using **Next.js** that helps NGOs and government agencies collaborate through **open APIs and real-time dashboards** during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones.

The platform acts as a **central command system** where all relief-related data — food, shelters, rescue teams, and affected people — is collected, processed, and displayed in one place so decisions can be made quickly and accurately.

## ❓ Why We Are Building This

During disasters, relief operations often fail not because resources are unavailable, but because **information is scattered** across different NGOs and government departments.

### Common problems today:

* NGOs don’t know what other NGOs have supplied
* Government doesn’t know which shelters are full
* Rescue teams don’t know where help is needed most
* Decisions are made using outdated or incomplete data

### This results in:

* Wasted food and medicine
* Overcrowded shelters
* Delayed rescue operations

Our platform solves this by creating a **single real-time data hub** where:

* NGOs can upload what they are providing
* Government can monitor and coordinate
* Everyone sees the same live situation

This leads to **faster response, better planning, and more lives saved**.

## 🚀 Future Scope

This platform can be expanded into a **national-level disaster management system**. In the future, it can support:

* 📍 GPS tracking of rescue teams and relief vehicles
* 🤖 AI-based prediction of shortages and high-risk areas
* 🌐 Integration with international relief organizations
* 📊 Advanced analytics for government planning and budgeting

With these additions, the system can become a **complete digital backbone for disaster response**.
